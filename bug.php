This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to accessing array elements that might not exist.  If the key 'missing_key' is not present in the 
`$myArray` array, accessing it directly will result in a notice (in some PHP configurations) or a fatal error (depending on error reporting settings):
```php
<?php
$myArray = ['existing_key' => 'some value'];
echo $myArray['missing_key']; //This line might cause an error
?>
```

# PHP Notice: Undefined index error
This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: the "Undefined index" notice.  It occurs when you attempt to access an array element using a key that does not exist.

The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution using isset() to check for the key's existence before accessing it.

This is a crucial concept for writing robust and error-free PHP applications.
